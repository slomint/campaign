# campaign
campaign is a series of scripts written for the purpose of improving the coordination of assessing a flat network for vulnerabilities through the reconnaissance process all the way through post-exploitation. It was written primarily for usage in the Attack-and-Defend Capture-the-Flag (CTF) security competition Panoply. 

It is advised that the programs in this repository should only be used for educational purposes and in a safe setting such as in a local (in-house) CTF or offensive security competition where its usage would be allowed.
